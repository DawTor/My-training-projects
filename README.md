# My Training projects!

To practice programming in python, I will write little projects and add it here for me as a little help, when I will forget something and for everybody, who want to programming in python, and don't know, how can be something written :)

# Number-guess-game
You can play a number guess game!
To start game, you must just run code in your IDE, where you have installed Python. Have fun!!

# Dice roll simulator
Super easy dice simulator. You can roll as long as you say "yes". For other answer, program will say you "bye" :)
